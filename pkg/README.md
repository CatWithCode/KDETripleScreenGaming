# Gaming with Really big Window.
Not much to it, resizes Window.

You first must place the middle screen pixel perfect where you need it.
Use “kscreen-doctor output.DP-1.position.1080,50” with your Data.
I use PLP (2 rotated screens and one Landscape in the middle). |-| = 1080,1440,1080.

Then you must go into the main.js and set the position and size.
Thats it. Now just create a .tar archive and rename its extension to “.kwinscript” and install it as a Kwin-Script.
Now you can use META+G.
